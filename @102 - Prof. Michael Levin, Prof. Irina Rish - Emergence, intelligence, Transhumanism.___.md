	- Michael Levin is a Distinguished Professor in the Biology department at Tufts University, and the holder of the Vannevar Bush endowed Chair. He is the Director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts and the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology. His research focuses on understanding the biophysical mechanisms of pattern regulation and harnessing endogenous bioelectric dynamics for rational control of growth and form. The capacity to generate a complex, behaving organism from the single cell of a fertilized egg is one of the most amazing aspects of biology. Levin' lab integrates approaches from developmental biology, computer science, and cognitive science to investigate the emergence of form and function. Using biophysical and computational modeling approaches, they seek to understand the collective intelligence of cells, as they navigate physiological, transcriptional, morphognetic, and behavioral spaces. They develop conceptual frameworks for basal cognition and diverse intelligence, including synthetic organisms and AI. Also joining us this evening is Irina Rish. Irina is a Full Professor at the Université de Montréal's Computer Science and Operations Research department, a core member of Mila - Quebec AI Institute, as well as the holder of the Canada CIFAR AI Chair and the Canadian Excellence Research Chair in Autonomous AI. She has a PhD in AI from UC Irvine. Her research focuses on machine learning, neural data analysis, neuroscience-inspired AI, continual lifelong learning, optimization algorithms, sparse modelling, probabilistic inference, dialog generation, biologically plausible reinforcement learning, and dynamical systems approaches to brain imaging analysis.

		- The notion of emergence in [[Systems engineering]] says that the new behavior appears on the [[Boundary]] of the [[System]] in the [[Context]]. It is something that cannot be deducted or [[Abduction]] from the [[System model]]. Otherwise it would not be "emergent".

		- role:: [[Method engineer]] [[Ontology Engineering]]
		- The whole discussion is about whether there are clear boundaries (steps on the ladder), where new behavior appears. The argument of Rish goes there are clear boundaries that can be observed for emergent phenomena, and Levin's take is that it is a continuum of emergence. Still, Levin says that there are systems and subsystems present in living organisms, which means there are [[Boundary]].
		- Also, in the transcript they discuss a metric that allows to calculate boundaries, which is interesting in regards to [[@Measuring Modularity: Engineering and Management Effects of Different Approaches]] and [[@The Dark Side of Modularity: How Decomposing Problems Can Increase System Complexity]]. What is a role of [[Governance]] here?

	- ((64085cd0-5765-4821-908c-3fc6068aa443))
		- role:: [[Method engineer]] [[Ontology Engineering]]
		- In other words, can we apply the emergency concepts from biology, ((640851e4-3686-404a-80c4-2a18c00811f9)), to the #AI ? Finally, Levin says yes, we can because the matter can do fascinating things.

		- role:: [[Epistemology]] [[STS]]
		- Can we say that even basic things in [[Exocortex]] also contribute to the intelligence? At some point it somehow similar to [[ANT]], where the [[Course of action]] is a result of [[@Actor-Network Theory. Objects and actants, networks and narratives]].

		- role:: [[Recruitment methodologist]]
		  How do we assess and evaluate the intelligence [[Intellect]] during the recruitment process and performance reviews? The SFIA, STAR techniques and all that very well fit to the criteria proposed in this discussion. Anyway, the #ResearchThemes is how do we get [[performance metrics]] to compare the candidates?

		- The question is whether things and tools have their own [[Agency]] and we cannot apply leadership to them, only engineering. Where is this regulator that allows us to efficiently control the organization? What are the control circuits? What is a feedback? How does [[Compliance]] work in this scheme? Can [[AI]] be a subject to compliance?

		- Also, business rule manifesto says something like this, but it's not in the bibliography.
		- ((640863f1-d6e6-4fc0-8097-5818e9fb0445)) - how does [[Обратная связь|Feedback]] really works? I have an outline for this idea got wrong, need to write a text about it.
		- ((6408643f-8ff0-479c-a388-19c64066be09)) - the term scales does refer to [[Boundary object]] [[@Across Boundaries of Influence and Accountability: The Multiple Scales of Public Sector Information Systems]] and we are talking about the protocols for coordination and collaboration.

		  Can we say that [[Organizational unit]] structure with interfaces (reporting lines) is the minimal reducible structure? It's almost the same logic that I used in the WBS 4D paradigm article. Causal relationships between system levels. Cause as irreducible element.
		- ((64086b35-6c99-4bfd-9afa-f089b1eb8667)) - to define the business function we need to discover and measure the level of emergency. How much does it contribute to the success of the organization?

		- So when we assign people on roles we should adjust their level of responsibility to the level of agency, causality, extent to which they control the domain and can get the desired outcome. And to have a metrics for that fitness would be great.

		- The axis of persuadability (metric of [[Agency]] for [[Actor]] ). A proposed way to visualize a continuum of agency, which frames the problem in a way that is testable and drives empirical progress, is *via* an “axis of persuadability”: to what level of control (ranging from brute force micromanagement to persuasion by rational argument) is any given system amenable, given the sophistication of its cognitive apparatus?

		- So, when we talk about command and control, and [[Enterprise architecture]], we can measure agency metrics and say how emergent is this level.
