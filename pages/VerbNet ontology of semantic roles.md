- **Actor** - Participant that is the instigator of an event. - Not currently instantiated, superordinate role in hierarchy only.
- **Agent** - Actor	in	an event	who	initiates and carries out	the event intentionally or consciously,	and who exists independently of	the event. - *admit-65, beg-58.2, cooking-45.3, force-59*
- **Asset** - Value that is a concrete object. - *bill-54.5, pay-68*
- **Attribute** - Undergoer that is a property of an entity or entities, as opposed to the entity itself. - *assessment-34.1, calabratable_cos 45.6*
- **Beneficiary** - Undergoer in a state or an event that is (potentially) advantaged or disadvantaged by the event or state. - *cost-54.2, get-13.5.1*
- **Cause** - Actor in an event (that may be animate or inanimate) that initiates the event, but that	does not act with any intentionality or consciousness; it exists independently of the event. - *indicate-78, free-80*
- **Co-Agent** - Agent who is acting in coordination or reciprocally with another agent while participating in the same event (specific to events with symmetrical participants). - *cooperate-73, meet-36.3*
- **Co-Patient** - Patient that participates in an event with another patient, both participate equally in the event (specific to events with symmetrical participants). - *mix-22.1*
- **Co-Theme** - Theme that participates in an event or state with another Theme; both participate equally (thereby distinguishing this role from Pivot; specific to events with symmetrical participants). - *cling-22.5, multiply-108*
- **Destination** - Goal that is a concrete, physical location. - *bring-11.3, carry-11.4*
- **Duration** - Length or extent of time.
- **Experiencer** - Patient that is aware of the event undergone (specific to events of perception). - *flinch-40.5, see-30.1*
- **Extent** - Value indicating the amount of measurable change to a participant over the course of	the event. - *calabratable_cos-45.6*
- **Final_Time** - Time that indicates when an event ends or a state becomes false. - *Not currently	instantited, hierarchy only*
- **Frequency** - Number of occurrences of an event within a given time span. - *Not currently	instantited, hierarchy only*
- **Goal** - Place that is the end point of an action and exists independently of the event. - *adjust-26.9, convert-26.6.*
- **Initial_Location** - Source that indicates the concrete, physical location where an event begins or a state becomes true. - *bring-11.3, carry-11.4*
- **Instrument** - Undergoer in an event that is manipulated by an agent, and with which an intentional act is performed; it exists independently of the event. - *destroy-44, tape-22.4*
- **Location** - Place that is concrete. - *appear-48.1.1, coil-9.6*
- **Material** - Patient that exists at the starting point of action (inheritance from Source), which is transformed through the event into a new entity; concrete or abstract. - *deduce-97.2, knead-26.5*
- **Participant** - Entity involved in a state or event.
- **Patient** - Undergoer in an event that experiences a change of state, location or condition, that	is causally involved or directly affected by other participants, and exists independently of the event. - *break-45.1, poison-42.2*
- **Pivot** - Theme that participates in an event with another theme unequally. Pivot is much more central to the event (thereby distinguishing it from Co-Theme). - *own-100, require-103*
- **Place** - Participant that represents the state in which an entity exists.
- **Product** - Result that is a concrete object. - *create-26.4, preparing-26.3*
- **Recipient** - Destination	that	is	animate. - *bill-54.5*
- **Result** - Goal that comes into existence through the event. - *bend-45.2, break-45.1*
- **Source** - Place that is the starting point of action; exists independently of the event. - *substance_emission-43.4*
- **Stimulus** - Cause in an event that elicits an emotional or psychological response (specific to events of perception) - *sight-302., stimulus_subject-30.4*
- **Time** - Participant that indicates an instant or an interval of time during which a state exists or an event took place. - *continue-55.3*
- **Theme** - Undergoer that is central to an event or state that does not have control over the way the event occurs, is not structurally changed by the event, and/or is characterized as being in a certain position or condition throughout the state. - *butter-9.9, hold-15.1*
- **Trajectory** - *escape-51.1, push-12*
- **Undergoer** - Participant in a state or event that is not an instigator of the event or state.
- **Value** - Place along a formal scale. - *cost-54.2*
