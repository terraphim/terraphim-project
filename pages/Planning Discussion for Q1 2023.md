- # Positioning
- ## Why we need to rethink and replan positioning?
- Before October 2022 the number of search tools over code - i.e. github was pretty small, countable one hand and pretty established. With ChatGPT hype getting traction the number of search tools is 1000+ and coming, so launching Terraphim AI with code search over Github and merging/overlaying results with Notion is no longer unique or appealing - the area is very crowded and needs substantial marketing investment to make a dent. We can still launch with code search and [[Take Control over your relevance]] proposal, but then we need to follow up quickly with some major differentiator out of our existing roadmap.
- For Terraphim we need to explore and speed up Graph Embeddings as differentiator and map it to [[Knowledge graph]] and [[Personal Knowledge Management]]
-
- # Terraphim Features
- Own relevance and search in knowledge retrieval across multiple haystacks
- Question/Answering
- ChatGPT like (OpenAssistant)/LLM
- ## Terraphim Features - Differentiators
- [[Graph Embeddings]]
- [[Feed your own Knowledge Graph as core of you own AI]]
- [[Share own KG with other people]]
- [[Be able to leverage other peoples KG with own AI assistant in search/knowledge retrieval]]=>[[Knowledge Entaglement]]
- [[Personal Finance categorisation and budget]]
- # Terraphim UX
- Search bar with results page
- Discord chatbot
- Email chatbot
-
- # Joint Opportunities
- # Terraphim Private cloud
- Enabling capabilities:
	- CD pipeline - earthly.dev
	- Packaging: Firecracker VM
		- Packaging atomic: chroot around binary for Atomic Server
	- Network: ZeroTier
	- Security: Login with Github (or Discord)
	- Monitoring (monit)
	- Autoscale UP (get new server)
	- Autoscale down (zip data folders and move to new server)
	- Redundancy of data ( backup to S3 or Redis Enterprise)
	- Availability (Resilience) of service (publish services and certificates + cache user auth into Redis Enterprise)
- # Evaluation of different search engines Tantivy vs Elastic etc
	- Roadmap item on Terraphim
	- Project for Ontola
- # Atomic Data Server
- Used as Metadata Store (MDS): stores types of entities and their relationship
- Used as MDS + Visualization: how to visualise data (CSS styles and FE related pre-processing)
- Used as "Mapper": stores how to map different data types from different haystacks to each other
- Configuration store for Terraphim (and Atomic)
- E-Commerce use-case: Donation driven roadmap for Terraphim, Features are "product".
- CMS core use case: multiple urls from the same KG based on queries
- # Non Tech/Methodological
- How to evaluate Relevance?
- How to choose right LLM for me?
- How to evaluate results of fine-tuning/training of LLM for me?
