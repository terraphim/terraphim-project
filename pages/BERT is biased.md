- BERT is biased...
  ...and so are other NLP methods when applied to causal tasks.

- I remember 2018 as it was today.
- My team and I were working on a big project for a global customer that could significantly cut their operational costs. The stakes were high and we wanted to give them the best possible solution. We were very excited! We tried a back-then-brand-new NLP model called ELMo and the early results were more than promising!
- But...
- ...before we concluded the experimental round, BERT paper had been published and we started to prepare a new pipeline! What a year!
- Since then, NLP has become perhaps the most recognizable ML technology and the public release of ChatGPT has largely contributed to this trend.
- Although text data is greatly valuable in social sciences, marketing and other areas, and although these areas can greatly benefit from casually valid conclusions, the intermarriage between NLP and causality was somehow delayed.
- Here are three resources that can help you start with causal NLP:
  ⭕ Amir Feder et al. (2022) - Causal Inference in Natural Language Processing: Estimation, Prediction, Interpretation and Beyond ([https://lnkd.in/d-bcz4Mn](https://lnkd.in/d-bcz4Mn)). This paper provides "a unified overview of causal inference for the NLP community". It's a comprehensive guide that discusses use cases and challenges of causal NLP adding fairness and interpretability contexts to the picture.
  ⭕ Victor Veitch et al. (2020) - Adapting Text Embeddings for Causal Inference ([https://lnkd.in/dBBRF_er](https://lnkd.in/dBBRF_er)). The authors propose to use "causally sufficient embeddings" in order to estimate causal effects from text and they present us with two use cases: predicitng causal effect of adding a theorem to a paper and estimating effects of adding author's gender information on social media content performance.
  ⭕ CausalBERT - a PyTorch implementation of the model introduced in "Adapting Text Embeddings for Causal Inference" ([https://lnkd.in/deCkXHp5](https://lnkd.in/deCkXHp5))
- 💡 Summarizing, NLP became a widely adopted set of techniques that can greatly benefit from integrating it with causality. Although combining the two might sometimes be challenging, we've seen some early successful attempts to do so. The three resources above will help you to start in the causal NLP world.
