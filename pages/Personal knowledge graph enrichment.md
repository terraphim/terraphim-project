- "What can you learn from this article?" Terraphim knowledge graph enrichment master proposes several workflows to the user.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Confirm relevant highlights.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Add synonyms for the terms.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Add persons to the network.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- **Confirm relevant highlights.** From the previous step, the user has the proposed highlights: Topical and extension terms, including their synonyms and proximate adjectives: System Maintenance; System Maintenance planning; maintenance concept; maintaining operational capability; maintenance process; maintainability of the system; system scheduled maintenance; reliability-centered maintenance strategy; preventive maintenance; corrective maintenance; Segmenting maintenance activities; approved maintenance subcontractors; maintenance/repair turn-around times; maintenance management; maintenance activities; maintenance plans; maintenance strategy; maintenance constraints;
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  ingested into a separate page of the personal knowledge graph with a mark-down.
	- The user accepts or refutes proposed highlights removing or leaving the markup.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Then the user goes through what's left and adds synonyms to the topic and other terms of the topical graph:
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  ![image.png](../assets/image_1689761210105_0.png){:height 862, :width 681}
	- Then he extends the frontmatter of the topical page and claim issues that the current model has (Maintenance graph has two of them):
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  ![image.png](../assets/image_1689769514847_0.png){:height 717, :width 681}
	- Now the user checks and adds persons: [[Scott Jackson]] - him we already have in the knowledge graph, we can add the frontmatter to start a dossier; [[Brian Gallagher]] and [[David Dorgan]] - absent until now, we create these pages.
